        <p>My hobby is drawing.I love drawing because it makes me feel better. I often get tensed about my school work and it help me calm down.A lot of my free time is spent drawing.When you want to find a way to take a break from distressing thoughts, drawing offers a way to focus your attention on something calming. Sketching, doodling, or coloring provides a way to ground yourself and get some peace from racing thoughts. </p>
